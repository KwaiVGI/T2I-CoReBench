The dragon is medium-sized with articulated joints and visible clockwork mechanisms throughout its body. Its scales are individual brass plates that overlap like medieval armor, and its eyes are glowing amber gemstones. The dragon has four legs with mechanical claws, and its wings are made of thin copper sheets with brass ribbing. It is not organic, being entirely mechanical in construction. Two steam vents are positioned along its spine, releasing small puffs of white vapor. The dragon's head features three rotating gear assemblies visible through transparent crystal panels. Its tail is segmented with spring-loaded joints and ends in a sharp brass spear point. The dragon's chest houses a large central clockwork heart that glows with warm golden light and produces visible ticking motion. Intricate engravings of Victorian flourishes decorate the brass surfaces, and tiny copper wires connect various mechanical components. The dragon is not corroded, maintaining its polished metallic appearance. Small brass screws and bolts are visible at every joint, and delicate filigree work adorns the wing membranes. The dragon shows no signs of rust and contains no modern electronic components.",
