A long robotic arm, which is a component of the research station, is extending towards the octopus, holding a glowing sample container. The octopus has two tentacles touching the station's dome. A group of fish is swimming between the octopus and the submarine, and their number is three times the number of tentacles touching the dome. The research station is built on top of a massive piece of glowing coral. The octopus is facing the research station. The submarine's front viewport is facing away from the station. The robotic arm is pushing some loose rocks away; the number of rocks is one more than the number of tentacles touching the dome. The glowing coral is the brightest light source. A diver in a wetsuit is swimming under the robotic arm, holding a camera and pointing it at the octopus.

    "Prompt": "A conference room with a long rectangular table in the center, around which are arranged six chairs. A presenter stands at a whiteboard at the head of the table. On the whiteboard are several hand-drawn diagrams. The presenter holds a marker. A projection screen, which is narrower than the whiteboard, is mounted on the wall behind the presenter, displaying a bar chart. The number of diagrams on the whiteboard is greater than the number of bars in the chart. A laptop is placed on the table in front of the presenter. Next to the laptop is a glass of water and a cup containing some pens; the number of pens is half the number of chairs. A conference phone is positioned at the table’s center. A clock is mounted above the projection screen. The presenter is pointing at the whiteboard. The laptop is closer to the presenter than to the phone.",
